# SSL-TLS-clientserver

1 SSL server switches context depending on the certificate-type client will use

2 using TLS extensions

3 it seems that to make switching ssl_ctx work requires openssl version is above 110+;

4 tested version 110f 110g 110h

5 openssl 102 series doesn't support customize TLS extension (tested version 102n)
